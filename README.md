# pySafe

python interface for the C FFI API of the SAFE Network (www.maidsafe.net)

contributors:  rid-dim, duncankushnir

The design goal of pySafe is to provide a full python interface to SAFE network, via the SAFE binaries.

The package (will) include an importable and installable module, as well as utilities to generate the bindings and
hopefully eventually some example applications beyond 'hello world'.

Currently in development, so it is quite raw.

On linux, running upg_local.sh will update your local environment to the current pySafe state
On windows, upg_local.bat...
