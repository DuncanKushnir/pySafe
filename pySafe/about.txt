For now, we try a flat structure.. the project is simple enough at present that we probably don't need sub modules

The structure is still fluid: At present, this is on a 'simplest thing that works' basis for the following goals.
-pypi available
-pip installable

* compilable is a goal, but there is no use compiling until there is a fully working 'server' inside the project.

Definite TODO:

- update extractor to write the '.h' files in ./extracted_headers
